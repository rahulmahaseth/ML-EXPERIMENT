## NUMPY
# Numpy is a library helps in doing all the scientific calculation.
# The default data-type of numpy is an array. 
### It helps in manuplating the data of matrix and array.
Numpy does calculation fastly over arrays.
we can create an array using numpy by using "numpy.array()" and "numpy.arange()" function.
we can check the dimension of array, matrix by "numpy.ndim"
check the shape of array and matrix using 'numpy.shape'
we can easily perform arthematic operation on array and matrix using numpy.
we can also create a matrix of higher dimnesion using the numpy.
